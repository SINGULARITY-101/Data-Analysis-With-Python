# Data-Analysis-With-Python
This repo contains the course project I did for the Jovian Data Analysis with python course. I performed data analysis on a dataset called "Video Game Sales" that I picked up from Kaggle. The dataset itself contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It has a total of 11 columns and 16,598 rows.
